      <h1>Description</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Founded by a MUIDS student on July 7th 2023, with support from his
        former classmates in section 1004, many of whom share similar interests
        in the field of journalism. MUIDS Press was created as a main media
        corporation under Mahidol University International Demonstration School,
        with two main clubs integrated into one category of Press. The
        organization held many responsibilities when it came to giving detailed
        and valuable information regarding the school events and the promotion
        of students literature or research works through the usage of
        publication in the Press official website or school broadcasting
        service.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We strive to not only become MUIDS main media but also to function as
        any other Press in the academia with regulations implemented as a
        precaution to our school reputation. The organization recognizes the
        talents of those with literary skills and the determination to explore
        the world of journalism, literature, academics, and research. We offer
        students the opportunity to have their works recognized officially by
        the school with the ensurement of maximum credibility. Our club
        activities are not limited to only school areas as we also provide
        students with events regarding community service, outdoor journalism
        activities, and their unbiased and non-controversial opinions regarding
        philosophies.
